# Data-Analysis
Data collections and Analytical Projects 
This is an early dataset collected for a project in my college statistics class last year.  My group had a month to conduct an analysis on any particular topic of our choosing. We focussed on overall life satisfaction and how it might be affected by household income. We chose to structure our anonymous survey with a variety of questions that we thought at the time would give us a better view of what might go into overall life satisfaction other than salary.  At the time, the data collected was exactly was was requested for the class requirements, but if the goal was to collect data to solve an issue, the questions on the survey did not allow for the type of data that could be used to make data-driven decisions.  The data collected in this project lends itself to a potential hypothesis, but we would have to employ different questions to gain more informative answers from our target audience to make any concrete analysis.
